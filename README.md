# docker-kubernetes-sample
This project provides a quick crash course, high-level overview, and tutorial for getting started with Docker and Kubernetes. All the files you need are in this repo. However, the dockerfile isn't written yet to build a docker image or run a docker container. (we will go through how to do this later on, the answers are in notes.txt for later reference though). I will start with a high-level overview of both docker and kubernetes and then walk you through the instructions for creating your own docker images, containers, and kubernetes deployments (locally). I will also breifly talk through the process of deploying onto kubernetes instead of using minikube (local dev).

## Wiki
In the wiki, you will find notes of all the talking points I covered during the ppt presentation in note format including Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, and the tutorial.
